The official Regal Lord Discord Bot
Purpose: to moderate and manage the entire Regal Lord discord. Assisted with Tatsumaki, Realm Discord Bot, and Webhooks. 

Integrations are required as the verification of members(not yet added) will be directly influenced by such integrations and a role with admin permissions. 

All webhooks must be manually set up and I will include a guide when the bot is in BETA testing.

# Regal Lords 
Regal Lords is a RotMG based guild that is built off of a friendship focus. The bot's capabilities are currently being designed for text chat and for voice chat and is heavily dependant on Google's public API, Discord's API(obviously lol), and Realmeye's Unofficial API by Nightfirecat, and eventually Reddit's public API. The purpose of all of these APis will be documented at a later date. 

# Regal Lords Rules

Rules for Regal Lords:
Rule 1:
If you are having any sort of conflict with a guildie, or if someone else is causing drama, don't let the situation escalate. Be the bigger person, ignore them for the time being, and let an officer or above know whatâ€™s going on so we can handle it privately with no public drama.

Rule 2:
We do not force you to be in the guild discord at all times, but to participate in guild time keys, you have to be on Discord. If a key opener wants you on Discord for their dungeon, get on. If at any time you just want to chill with friends, you know where to go. For different events, there are different channels to join. It is important because it keeps our dungeons clean and shows you are interested in the friendship experience.

Rule 3:
It is a requirement that you conduct yourself in a mature and respectful manner (don't be immature). If you cannot, we may be forced to kick you. No racism is allowed, joking with friends is alright but if you take it overboard, or if anyone asks you to stop, STOP.

Rule 4:
We're a friendship guild, trolling guild members with malice is not tolerated, and should be reported officers or above. Stay kind and friendly. You can rag on people you're cool with, just don't purposefully be a dick.

Rule 5:
If you suspect someone of hacking or exploiting in the guild, please do not take the responsibility on yourself; privately report to Founders, leaders, or officers and we will investigate and take proper action.

Rule 6:
If you would like to add your bot to use/test in this server, do not abuse that chance. We are giving you the opportunity to show off your bot's capabilities. You are not entitled to have it.

Rule 7:
You're required to be socially active on discord and make friends since we're a friendship guild, it's a way to show your loyalty to the guild. If you have any concerns, problems with members, or want to discuss guild matters, plz talk to any officer, leader, or founder.

Rule 8:
You need to have your microphone ready for guild time. Mic disabled and deafen isn't allowed unless you have a good reason, you could mute your mic or use push to talk instead.

Rule 9:
If you're kicked for being inactive and want to re-join, you will be put on the waiting list to get back in.

Rule 10:
We don't advocate for hacks nor discuss them in our guild.

Rule 11:
No excessive bullying allowed. Report complaints to officers and above. You will be kicked for bullying.

Rule 12:
Mic spam is not allowed during guild time, no yelling, no bots, no soundboards, you'll be server muted and not un-mute.

Rule 13:
Be cute!
